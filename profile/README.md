## About 
Analyze customer requirements and work with customers to design, build, or solve problems related to system implementation.

- I have been working as an application architect in the center of systems construction, and have been supporting or working in parallel with cloud architects, technical architects, data architects, and database administrators.
- I am able to approach problems from various perspectives and work efficiently in terms of work coordination and communication. I have been continuously working in the role of analyzing requirements, designing the necessary environment/system/solution, and verifying/sharing/applying through the definition of development standards and prototyping.
- As a senior architect/developer, I have worked to support and empower members to develop their capabilities and to contribute to organizational capacity building by supplementing their weaknesses.
